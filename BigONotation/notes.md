## Big O

-Tells us how good a solution to a problem is

-Distinguish between good code and bad code

## What is good code

1.Readable
  -is it clean,  can others understand it?
2.Scalable
  -Big O lets us measure did this

  -code = instructions
  -goes into computer = machine
  -results in output

  -there are inefficient and efficient ways of giving your computer instructions

## Big O and Scalability

-Speed of code is dependant on computer hardware and other factors

-Therefore speed is not necessarily a good indicator or code quality/efficiency

-Scalability: how much increasing number of inputs impacts code runtime
-When we grow bigger and bigger in our input, how much does the function slow down (how many more operations we have to do) -> Algorithmic Efficiency

-Big O notation is the language we use to measure how long it takes an algorithim to run

-Different algorithims have different efficiencies, the slower code slows down the better it is

## O(n)

O(n) ---> Linear Time, big O depends on number of inputs linearly 

## O(1)

O(1) --> Constant Time, very scalable
