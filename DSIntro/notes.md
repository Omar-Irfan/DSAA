## Data Structures
-Data Structure is a collection of values
-Algorithms are the steps/proccesses we implement to manipulate the values in a Data Structure
-Data Structures + Algorithms = ALL PROGRAMS

-Data Structure is a collection of values the values can have relationships among them and functions applied too them

-Each Data structure is different in what it can do and what it is best used for. Each data structure has its specialized used cases.

-Can store numbers, strings, booleans etc

-Arrays and Objects are Data Structures

2 parts to understanding Data Structures:

1. How to Build One

2. How to Use It

## How do Computers Store Data

-Computer is run by CPU, does all the calculation

-Variables are stored in RAM

-HDD/SDD/Flash Drive etc = Storage, that storage is permenant/ persistent

-RAM is not persistant, you lose the memory when the machine turns off

-Persistant storage is slow

-CPU's access RAM much faster than Storage.

-RAM is a massive storage area with shelves that are numbered called addresses, each shelf holds 8 bits. a bit is a tiny electrical switch that is either 1 or 0. 8 bits = 1 byte therefore each shelf has 1 byte of storage. 

-The CPU is connected to the memory controller which does the reading and writing of the RAM, the memory controller has individual connection to all the shelves so it can access them directly without having to traverse.

-Random Access Memory = we can access data in any random address of memory right way

-the closer info is to the CPU the faster it will run (accessing 0th shelf is much faster than accessing 1000th shelf)

-Computers get extra speed boosts when reading memory address close to each other

-CPU cache = small memory in CPU that stores recent memory

## What does this have to do with Data Structures

-Data structures store information

-variables can be store in RAM shelves (blocks of 8,16,32 or 64 bits of information)

## Integer overflow

-a computer can only store a certain amount of information
-If a number is too large too store in our RAM, JS will store it as Infinity
-A Data Structure is an arrangement of data
-You define how to engage with this data in RAM
-Our goal = minimize what we need to do to get the data from RAM to the CPU


## Operations on Data Structures
Some data structures are good at certain operations, others are good at others

1. Insertion - adding new items
2. Deletions - deleting existing items
3. Traversal - accessing each data item exactly once soo it can be processed
4. Searching - find location of item if it exists in a given location
5. Sorting - sorting data according to criteria like max val to min val
6. Access - How do we access this data on our computer
