## Graphs
-One of the most used and useful DS's when it comes to modeling real life
-Set of values that are related in a pairwise fashion
-each item is called a node or a vertex
-nodes are connected with edges
-used in recomendations, map apps etc
-graphs encompase things we already learned, linked lists are a type of tree and trees are a type of graph

-certain characteristics that can be used to describe graphs

## Directed vs Undirected
-Undirected you can go back and forth between nodes
-Directed are one way 
-friends vs followers/following on facebook and twitter

## Weighted vs Unweighted
-Can have have values associated with edges (for ex shortest distance on google maps)
-Weighted graphs weigh the path ways where as unweighted do not
-used in optimal paths

## Cyclic vs Acyclic

-When you can go from one node to another to another and eventually back to the original node its cyclic
-when you cant its acyclic

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

## Pros and cons

-so many different types so hard to do a general big O
Pros:
  relationships
Cons:
  scaling is hard
