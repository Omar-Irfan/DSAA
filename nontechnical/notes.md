## Hero Stories

## Technical
-Talk about To The Moon project
-Built with Phaser.io, React, Ruby on Rails, Express and Socket.io
-How the the team and I had to teach ourselves 2 technologies we had never used before too create a multiplayer space shooter game

## Success
-Talk about how at Bruce Power your contributions to the SAIP resulted in an 80 percent increase in addressing safety issues

## Leadership
-Talk about having a leadership role in the MSA and having to assist in navigating through tragedies like Quebec shooting, Christchurch and the one instance where the MSA wanted to collaborate with a student club that had political and financial links to a country that was committing atrocities and how I took a stance against that  inorder to prevent a collaboration that would go against the values of our club 

## Challenge
-At CNL talk about how I had to learn VBA programming by myself from scratch to create the 4D4P/RAP tool for the CNSC

## Tell me about yourself
-Your triggers of success
-Mention things you want to get ask
-Skills should be relevant to job
-Add to the ending, specific skills and what you did in the bootcamp
-Where do you wanna go next -> an opportunity that combines my past experiences with my coding

-I am recent graduate from Mechanical Engineering at McMaster. In one of my internships at CNL I had to program a tool in VBA for the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission that they would use to simulate accident scenarios in the power plants in ontario, I had to basically teach my self programming in order to create this tool
-This made me more interested in programming and pursuing it as a career. I then decided to use the pandemic as an opportunity to make a career shift into software development and enrolled in Lighthouse Labs bootcamp. Through the bootcamp and various projects I've learned React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails and computer science fundamentals like data structures and algorithims. Some of the projects I worked on include a crypto currency themed space shootergame called to the moon, an ecommerce website for a Pizza restaurant and an app for scheduling interviews

## What are your weaknesses
-pick something thats not important to the job
-or something that was a weakness that you've done to improve
-Story about collaboration and asking for help
-I haven't gotten exposure to working with a larger dev team 
-Not being able too accurately estimate how long something might take --> willing to take more hours
  -Learning experience from that was to look back on what you did and work to optimize work flow

-Haven't had the chance to be in a client facing role and want to gain more exposure to that
  -I saw you guys have toastmasters so I'd love to leverage something like that

-In general when I get a coding problem I like to jump right in without thinking about it first and I started noticing I'd be way more efficient if I didn't do that so now I tend to write pseudocode before hand to plan out my approach and take it from there

-Don't end story at weakness or failure mention how you are working to fix it --> didn't get stuck there

## What do you find most difficult about coding
-implementing ideas in my head
-bringing something intangible to tangible
-but merging creativity with coding is something I actually like and despite being difficult is probably my favourite aspect of it

## What was your favourite subject in school
-If you encounter a curveball question - have fun with it
-More value is on the explaination than the actual answer

## What is your greatest strength
-My greatest strength is being able to quickly learn and absorb new things, I've demonstrated this during my time at CNL where I had to create the VBA tool from scratch whilst self teaching (and then teaching it to my colleagues after I was done so they could take its development further) and in my own projects such as the To the moon game I built with 2 friends where we had to teach ourselves how to actually use the game engine phaser.io and websockets inorder to impliment multiplayer

## Why do you want to work for us
-Fairly AI: I researched the company and got an idea of what you guys do of trying to sanitize AI that might have been infected with biases, I'm interested in this concept because as a muslim and someone from an immigrant background with brown skin, a muslim name I have encountered several situations where I personally or someone I've known been "randomly selected" at an airport or something (including my cousin who at the age of 10 was flagged by the TSA) so trying to remove race/gender/religious based biases in processes like this is something quite important to me.


-Don't mention chernobyl
-Say you will get too wear a lot of hats but doesn't denegrate corporate culture
