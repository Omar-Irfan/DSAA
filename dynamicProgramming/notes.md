## Dynamic Programming 
-Optimization technique
-Doesn't mean anything lol
-Uses caching 
-Solving problems by breaking them down into sub problems
-storing subproblems solutions incase same sub problem occurs


## Caching
-way too store values to use later on -> think of it like a backpack
-speed up programs by holding data in an easily accessiible box
-Memoization is a specific form of caching used in dynamic programming

## Memoization
-Caching the return value of a function based on its parameters
-if parameter of the function doesn't change then the value is memoized - has already done the exact same calculation in the past

Dynaimc Programming = Divide and Conquer + Memoization

## Steps to see if you can do Dynamic Programming
1.Can be divided into subproblem - is it tree like?
2.that usually indicates a recursive solution
3.are there repetitive sub problems? - same calculation over and over again?
4.memoize sub problems
