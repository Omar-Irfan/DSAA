-Hierarchical structure not linear
-each parent node can have 0 or more child nodes
-start with root node
-nodes at the very end are leaf nodes
-can have sub trees
-DOM is a tree data structure
-AI in games like chess used to use trees to make decisions (before machine learning)
-Social media comments
-Abstract syntax tree

-Just like linkedlists, we use nodes in trees
-Can have any info in a node (user information, a value etc)
-Linkedlist is technically a type of tree but with just one path
-A node can only point to a child, nodes do not reference their parent 

-Many types of tree data structures
